# Workshop in Applied Ethics
## Answer the Questions

1) If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?

      - The judicial system would not be required if all people conducted themselves in an ethical manner. Laws are mostly extentions of
      the morals and ethics of the society they are made in so, if everyone followed the same code of ethics, there would be no need
      for laws and no need for punishment for breaking those laws.
   
2) Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example    of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle      of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

   - Banning smoking in public is an example of the group being favered over the individual. Not long ago individuals were allowed to        smoke tobacco almost anywhere. Now people are restricted in where they can smoke, mostly not where others are for work or                recreation. Smoking in any public space, inside or out, is now banned in most cities. With smoking, some individuals are infringing      on the rights of others. By smoking in public places, they are putting the non smokers health at risk. The smokers on the other          hand have the right to manage there health how they see fit and to be able to partake in legal activities with out undue burdens.        To balance the individual and the goup inerests in this case I would have left much of the segragation to individual businesses.        For example, a bar could decide they want to allow smoking in their establishment. The bar would be registered as a smoking              permited establishment. Any one wishing to patronize the bar or seek employment there would have to be in agreement with the            policy. If they were not they should not seek employment there or go there to do business. This way people who smoke could enjoy        the services of the bar, smoke while they are there and not infringe on the rights of none smokers. None smokes need not go to this      establishment and can avoid the health risks associated with second hand smoke. By the same reasoning an establishment can declare      itself an non smoking facility and all the above would apply except everyone there would be a non smoker.
   
3) (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. An ethical code relies on the cooperation of the individuals.        Discuss how rogue behavior (aka defection) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the prisoner's dilemma and the      eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of      defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?

   - Preventing rogues in our company is a priority because this type of behavior can derail the entire company and cause the downfall        of the whole group. A way to incentivize employees to avoid rogue behavior is to hold random checks on random employees to make          sure our code of ethics is being upheld. If after the check it is found that they are being upheld, provide a monetary award,            because most of the time a person might be unethical is due to greed and greed being a product of money. Also if employees pass          inspections, they will be more eligable to raises and promotions. We would also use technilogical mutation to change the frequency      of the of the access to certain levels of security to prevent unauthorized access to data. Some incentives for following the code        of ethics could be company wide recognition or a small monetary gift.

## Class Activities

1) In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small tech startup. Then:

   i) Members:
   
         Leean Woo
      
         Vincent Feil
      
         Jessica Gardner
      
         Joaquin Trujillo
      
         Bruce Liu
   
   ii) Pick a president and write their name below. 
   
         Vincent Feil
   
   iii) Describe your technical innovation below.
   
   Computer that can run any Operating System/Software 
   
2) Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society.

   i) Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to misuse) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and             mechanisms you can embed that.
   
      Adverse effects: a) It hinders ability to adapt to different softwares/UI. b) It would affect the job market due to companies           losing proprietary ownership of specific products. c) It would force custoemrs to discard old laptops adding on to the harm of           our environment.

      Helpful effects: a) It would provide economic freedom for the individual. b)It would add ease in the evelopement of new                 products.
         
    ii) Below, give an explicit definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its          lifetime: 
    
    (a) immediately upon launch; 
    
      a. Immediately upon launch: It would cause a spike in laptops being thrown away and cause excess waste and impact on the                    enviornment 
    
    (b) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.
    
      b. After enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life: We would lose the ability to adapt to different                              softwares or User Interfaces.
     
3) Your small "band of merry psychopaths" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?

  i) Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values      while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have at most 9 points.
  1. Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original. 
     No products we design or build will violate any laws or regulations that apply.
  2. Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are recieving and taking.
