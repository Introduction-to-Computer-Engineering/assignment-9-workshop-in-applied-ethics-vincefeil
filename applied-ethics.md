# Workshop in Applied Ethics
## Answer the Questions

1) If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?

      - The judicial system would not be required if all people conducted themselves in an ethical manner. Laws are mostly extensions of
      the morals and ethics of the society they are made in so, if everyone followed the same code of ethics, there would be no need
      for laws and no need for punishment for breaking those laws.
   
2) Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existence, of the group. Give an example    of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle      of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

   - Banning smoking in public is an example of the group being favored over the individual. Not long ago individuals were allowed to        smoke tobacco almost anywhere. Now people are restricted in where they can smoke, mostly not where others are for work or                recreation. Smoking in any public space, inside or out, is now banned in most cities. With smoking, some individuals are infringing      on the rights of others. By smoking in public places, they are putting the nonsmokers health at risk. The smokers on the other          hand have the right to manage their health how they see fit and to be able to partake in legal activities without undue burdens.        To balance the individual and the group interests in this case I would have left much of the segregation to individual businesses.        For example, a bar could decide they want to allow smoking in their establishment. The bar would be registered as a smoking              permitted establishment. Anyone wishing to patronize the bar or seek employment there would have to be in agreement with the            policy. If they were not they should not seek employment there or go there to do business. This way people who smoke could enjoy        the services of the bar, smoke while they are there and not infringe on the rights of nonsmokers. Nonsmokers need not go to this      establishment and can avoid the health risks associated with secondhand smoke. By the same reasoning an establishment can declare      itself a nonsmoking facility and all the above would apply except everyone there would be a nonsmoker.
   
3) (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. An ethical code relies on the cooperation of the individuals.        Discuss how rogue behavior (aka defection) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the prisoner's dilemma and the      eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of      defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?

   - Preventing rogues in our company is a priority because this type of behavior can derail the entire company and cause the downfall        of the whole group. A way to incentivize employees to avoid rogue behavior is to hold random checks on random employees to make          sure our code of ethics is being upheld. If after the check it is found that they are being upheld, provide a monetary award,            because most of the time a person might be unethical is due to greed and greed being a product of money. Also, if employees pass          inspections, they will be more eligible to raises and promotions. We would also use technological mutation to change the frequency      of the of the access to certain levels of security to prevent unauthorized access to data. Some incentives for following the code        of ethics could be company wide recognition or a small monetary gift.

## Class Activities

1) In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small tech startup. Then:

   i) Members:
   
      Leean Woo
      
      Vincent Feil
      
      Jessica Gardner
      
      Joaquin Trujillo
      
      Bruce Liu
   
   ii) Pick a president and write their name below. 
   
      Vincent Feil
   
   iii) Describe your technical innovation below.
   
   A computer that can run any Operating System/Software. 
   
2) Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society.

   i) Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to misuse) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and             mechanisms you can embed that.
   
      Adverse effects: a) It hinders ability to adapt to different software’s/UI. b) It would affect the job market due to companies           losing proprietary ownership of specific products. c) It would force customers to discard old laptops adding on to the harm of           our environment.

      Helpful effects: a) It would provide economic freedom for the individual. b)It would add ease in the development of new                 products.
         
    ii) Below, give an explicit definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its          lifetime:  
    
      a. Immediately upon launch: It would cause a spike in laptops being thrown away and cause excess waste and impact on the                    environment 
    
      b. After enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life: We would lose the ability to adapt to different                              software’s or User Interfaces.
     
3) Your small "band of merry psychopaths" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course?

    i) Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values      while not stifling innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have at most 9 points.
  1. Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original. 
     No products we design or build will violate any laws or regulations that apply.
  2. Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are receiving and taking.
     All information gathered by the company will be secure and used only for the purposes stated. We will never sell or otherwise
     compromise customer or supplier information.
  3. All employees and officers of the company will avoid conflicts of interest.
     No employee of the company will engage in any activity that is in conflict with the goals of the company. Further no employee with 
     hold employment of any kind with a competing company or a company we do business with. 
  4. No employee will accept or convey a bribery. 
     No employee will accept or give lavish gifts to or from anyone we do business with. Lavish is defined as anything with a monetary
     value over ($100.00) One Hundred Dollars. 
  5. Our product/software will be accessible to everyone who seeks it.
     Our product is intended to help people everywhere. To this end we will not discriminate in any way against anyone. 
  6. Our employees are the heart of our business and will treat each other with respect, fairness, and equally.
     No employee will create a hostile uncomfortable environment for any other employee. 
     Passionate, efficient and skilled people make a significant contribution to our success. We expect and
     promote an entrepreneurial mindset, innovative thinking, people taking initiative, reliability and a sense of
     responsibility.
  7. Customers will be treated with respect, fairness, equally, and with diligence.
     Without customers we have no business. Therefore, each customer will receive the same service and care we expect ourselves. Our 
     customer service will have the same high quality standards as our products.
  8. Honor customer confidentiality.
     We will never sell or otherwise compromise customer or supplier information.
  9. Produce highest quality possible.
     The pursuit of quality is core to our approach in everything we do. 
     Our products are designed and built to the highest technical standards and offer excellent functionality and ease of
     use.
     
  4) (BONUS) Ethical codes are vulnerable to hostile takeover of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them      remove 3 points from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall.
  
     1. Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original.  **Choice for deletion exploit**
     2. Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are receiving and taking.  **Choice for deletion exploit**
     3. All employees and officers of the company will avoid conflict of interest. 
     4. No employee will accept or convey a bribe.  **Choice for deletion exploit**
     5. Our product/software will be accessible to everyone who seeks it. 
     6. Employees will treat each other will respect, fairness, and equally. 
     7. Customers will be treated with respect, fairness, equality, and diligence. 
     8. Honor customer confidentiality.
     9. Produce highest quality possible.

     i)Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
     
      a)  Follow copyright laws, our work will be honest and original.* 
          Removing this point would make production faster but lose public trust, at least in the United States of America. It also               opens opportunity for litigation.
      b)  Be transparent, let the user know exactly what data/information we are receiving and taking.*
          Removing this point would make it to where actions could be done in stealth. This allows for data mining and selling                     information, which is very valuable.  A person that is also breaking this rule would have the ability to uncover it. Without               this point, it opens up opportunity for litigation and also loses public trust.
      c)  No employee will accept or convey a bribe.* 
          Removing this point would allow the person or company to be bought out. We would lose control of the mission and any ethics we           hope to preserve. This would also make the company lose public trust.
          
      ii) Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it robust to disruption. Note:                 Beware of the paradox of self-amendment, which, in short, "...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own                   amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent           with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."
      
        We could have given an exact definition for what is expected from the employees, adding detail and specifics, as well as a               general definition of each point in our code.
